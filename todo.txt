---------------------
Bugs

- react_devtools_backend.js:6 The AudioContext is "suspended". Invoke Tone.start() from a user action to start the audio.
- prevent AudioContext warnings?

---------------------
---------------------
Technical

- review all chords, advanced ones are broken or off screen; simplify to one drop down, drop complex ones?
- Reactivate loading screen but make it smoother
- review var/let/const
- use context? refactor?
- use typescript
- launch from github? (.io)
- add accessibility (aria)
- check mobile responsiveness, touch events

---------------------
Key Info

- when I have "C Major" selected, I should be able to easily select "Minor Natural/Harmonic/Medolic", and switch between the 4 times easily. work that in better key selection at the top of the key box. try to make chord selection similar?
- in key info, pair I II III IV... to chords.
- in key info, better show "functional harmony" with tonic, dominant, and subdominant, like on pianolit.com, but more interactive
- show I II III IV... on wheel

---------------------
Wheel

- option to rotate the CoF or not (relative vs. absolute visualization) - maybe don't auto select key on rotate wheel?
- show enharmonics in wheel
- make wheel rotate by drag and drop

-------------------------
Chord Info

- move chord selection to bottom? if so, make picker up to top instead of bottom
- chord builder instead of picker: start with a note, and add intervals

-------------------------
Keyboard

- Add volume slider and mute top left of keyboard
- play notes above keyboard: play separate, play together (2 buttons, find keyboard shortcuts?).
- view keyboard shortcuts can be moved below, along with shortcuts themselves.
- chord predictions should be moved below keyboard, and always ordered alphabetically, use small buttons

-------------------------
Medium Priority

- key/chord selection: combine name with pickers
- tooltips?
- Flesh out menu: help (modal to explain), settings (?), keyboard shortcut guide (esp. for delete, enter, caps lock)
- "Help" stuff may be distributed along with elements, rather than just at the top. Use help icons throughout with tooltips? Toggle to hide Help icons, also hides keyboard labels?
- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM
- invert chords? transpose keys?

-------------------------
Very Low Priority

- chord progression, chord inversions

(C has same pattern... could suggest progressions and play them; minor key might have different progressions)
Common chord progressions in the key of D major are as follows:

I – IV – V (D – G- A)
I – vi – IV – V (D – Bm – G – A)
ii – V – I (Em7 – A7 – Dmaj7)

- guitar tabs
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
