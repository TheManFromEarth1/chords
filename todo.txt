Bugs

- react_devtools_backend.js:6 The AudioContext is "suspended". Invoke Tone.start() from a user action to start the audio.
- fix volume/mute
- prevent AudioContext warnings?

Technical

- review all chords, advanced ones are broken or off screen; simplify to one drop down, drop complex ones?
- Reactivate loading screen but make it seemless/smoother
- use typescript
- add accessibility (aria)
- check mobile responsiveness, touch events

Misc

- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM

Low Priority

- chord inversions
- chord progression suggestions
- drag and drop within chord progression, from grades list to chord progression
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
