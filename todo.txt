Bugs:

- improper pitched notes for D Augmented Major 7th
- prevent AudioContext warnings

Technical:

- Reactivate loading screen but make it smoother
- review var/let/const
- use context?
- use typescript
- launch from github? (.io)

High Priority:

- in key info, turn "Chord" list into radio buttons to select chord. will need to move chosenChord up to Layout.
- add chord finder in chord chart (select inputs?)

- chord finder/selector with series of dropdowns
- after playing a chord, play all of them at once (playChord function doesn't exist yet)
- decouple "piano" into a component, and all the play functions are used by importing it into whatever component needs it. selected notes would be managed by Keyboard? Layout? global?
- "Help" stuff may be distributed along with elements, rather than just at the top. Use help icons throughout with tooltips? Toggle to hide Help icons, also hides keyboard labels?
- Add volume slider and mute in menu
- in key info, better show "functional harmony" with tonic, dominant, and subdominant, like on pianolit.com, but more interactive
- clearer indicators of selected items in wheel

Medium Priority:

- ctrl + click to unselect key entirely and skip enharmonics?
- Flesh out menu: help (modal to explain), settings (?), keyboard shortcut guide (esp. for delete, enter, key + space to select)
- show enharmonics in wheel
- make wheel rotate by drag and drop
- make mobile responsive, with touch events
- add accessibility (aria)
- add metronome with adjustable beats

Low Priority
- If layout is too busy, add toggles to show/hide advanced info like keyboard shortcuts, some tabs (simple mode?)
- TAB: show info about single notes, maybe as another tab in the key/chord area
- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM
- TAB: single note information?
- show emoji qualities about chords: happy/sad/tense/satisfying/etc.
- invert chords? transpose keys?

Very Low Priority
- chord progression
- guitar tabs
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
