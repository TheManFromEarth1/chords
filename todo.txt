Bugs

- fix AudioContext
- fix volume/mute

Technical

- use context
- review keys/chords for accuracy
- reactivate loading screen but make it seemless/smoother
- use typescript
- add accessibility (aria)

Misc

- make wheel and staff into boxes, make all draggable, use local storage to save open states and locations
- sound wave: add slider to top left, and on top right add a play button
- chord progressions: save custom chords (add selected notes, remembers C4 vs C5 vs C6)
- simplify boxes (menu/footer not needed?), only render boxes when not closed (move <Box> to app, bodies are then suppressed)
- chord search: escape to focus out

Low Priority

- chord inversions
- chord progression suggestions
- drag and drop within chord progression, from grades list to chord progression
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
