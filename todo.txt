Bugs:

- prevent AudioContext warnings
- playing scales twice fast will not cancel previous highlights

Technical:

- Smoother loading screen
- review var/let/const
- use context?
- move common functions to utils.js?
- use typescript
- launch from github? (.io)

High Priority:

- decouple "piano" into a component, and all the play functions are used by importing it into whatever component needs it. selected notes would be managed by Keyboard? Layout? global?
- update layout to: menu, staff, keyboard, (Wheel, Tabs: Key/Chords/Waves/...); consider tabs to be actions you want to make: find chord, explore keys, see sine waves, etc. see if it makes sense to do just one at a time.
- move keyboard shortcuts below keyboard, allow toggle off, have other toggles below keyboard for behavior?
- move "Play Selected" and "Clear Selected" buttons in line with staff, simplify.
- Add info (go to github, about, etc.), help (modal to explain), settings (?), keyboard shortcut guide (esp. for delete, enter, key + space to select)
- "Help" stuff may be distributed along with elements, rather than just at the top. Use help icons throughout with tooltips? Toggle to hide Help icons, also hides keyboard labels?
- Add volume slider and mute in menu
- clean up list of selected keys, maybe not needed?
- move staff to above keyboard, chords to above - show bass, clef + 1 line, include C in between. show key signature, show live keys, show selected notes, selected chord/key
- clearer indicators of selected items in wheel
- loading screen, before samples are loaded

Medium Priority:

- show enharmonics on black key labels
- show enharmonics in wheel
- make wheel rotate by drag and drop
- chord finder/selector with series of dropdowns
- after playing a chord, play all of them at once (playChord function doesn't exist yet)
- in key info, better show "functional harmony" with tonic, dominant, and subdominant, like on pianolit.com, but more interactive
- when a key or chord is selected on the keyboard, once you select/unselect a key, it "disconnects" or discolors that selection, or deselects the key
- selecting key should be double click/single click should just play, or at least have a toggle to change the behavior. same for selecting chord in wheel vs. playing and selecting?
- consider decoupling selected keys vs. highlighted keys for showing key scale, and chords. maybe selected is user only, with open to "select highlighted", "play highlighted" and "play selected". auto actions would not select keys, just highlight them. so selecting is for detecting chords only.
- make mobile responsive, with touch events
- add accessbility (aria)
- add metronome with adjustable beats

Low Priority
- If layout is too busy, add toggles to show/hide advanced info like keyboard shortcuts, some tabs (simple mode?)
- TAB: show info about single notes, maybe as another tab in the key/chord area
- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM
- TAB: single note information?
- show emoji qualities about chords: happy/sad/tense/satisfying/etc.
- invert chords? transpose keys?

Very Low Priority
- guitar tabs
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
