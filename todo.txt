---------------------
Bugs

- react_devtools_backend.js:6 The AudioContext is "suspended". Invoke Tone.start() from a user action to start the audio.
- fix volume/mute
- prevent AudioContext warnings?

---------------------
---------------------
Technical

- review all chords, advanced ones are broken or off screen; simplify to one drop down, drop complex ones?
- Reactivate loading screen but make it seemless/smoother
- review var/let/const
- use context? refactor?
- use typescript
- add accessibility (aria)
- check mobile responsiveness, touch events

---------------------
Key Info/Wheel

- better colour coding and CSS for wheel. ideally, select key using spoke svg, not the note text (hover state: background)
- show enharmonics in wheel
- on wheel, when clicking an already selected chord, suggest selecting the enharmonic?
- easy way to play chords from buttons in key info. maybe if key is already selected, play it?

-------------------------
Keyboard

- play notes above keyboard: play separate, play together (2 buttons, find keyboard shortcuts?).
- view keyboard shortcuts can be moved below, along with shortcuts themselves.
- does it make sense to move chord predictions below keyboard?

-------------------------
Medium Priority

- type a formula to select a chord (next to predicted)
- tooltips?
- Flesh out menu: help (modal to explain), settings (?), keyboard shortcut guide (esp. for delete, enter, caps lock)
- "Help" stuff may be distributed along with elements, rather than just at the top. Use help icons throughout with tooltips? Toggle to hide Help icons, also hides keyboard labels?
- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM
- invert chords? transpose keys?

-------------------------
Very Low Priority

- chord progression, chord inversions

(C has same pattern... could suggest progressions and play them; minor key might have different progressions)
Common chord progressions in the key of D major are as follows:

I – IV – V (D – G- A)
I – vi – IV – V (D – Bm – G – A)
ii – V – I (Em7 – A7 – Dmaj7)

- guitar tabs
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
