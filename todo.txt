---------------------
Bugs

- selecting a chord doesn't draw the lines right away, at least in the first instance? maybe online only
- prevent AudioContext warnings?

---------------------
---------------------
Technical

- review all chords, advanced ones are broken or off screen; simplify to one drop down, drop complex ones?
- Reactivate loading screen but make it smoother
- review var/let/const
- use context? refactor?
- use typescript
- launch from github? (.io)
- add accessibility (aria)

---------------------
---------------------
Key Info

- show I II III IV... on wheel
- in key info, pair I II III IV... to chords.
- in key info, better show "functional harmony" with tonic, dominant, and subdominant, like on pianolit.com, but more interactive
- generate notes/intervals same as chord (move to common function in utils?)
- when I have "C Major" selected, I should be able to easily select "Minor Natural/Harmonic/Medolic", and switch between the 4 times easily. work that in better key selection at the top of the key box. try to make chord selection similar?
---------------------
---------------------
Wheel

- option to rotate the CoF or not (relative vs. absolute visualization) - maybe don't auto select key on rotate wheel?
- show enharmonics in wheel
- show top of wheel
- make wheel rotate by drag and drop
-------------------------
-------------------------
Chord Info

- move chord selection to bottom? if so, make picker up to top instead of bottom
- chord builder instead of picker: start with a note, and add intervals
-------------------------
-------------------------
Menu

- Add volume slider and mute in menu

-------------------------
-------------------------
Medium Priority

- key/chord selection/prediction: combine name with pickers, move prediction to bottom?
- pressing "ALT" (or Shift?) on keyboard will allow selection of CHORDS on wheel. change colour of wheel letters on shift. draw line between key/chord boxes to center of wheel, and on ALT, change which line is coloured vs. palegrey
- tooltips?
- decouple "piano" into a component, and all the play functions are used by importing it into whatever component needs it. selected notes would be managed by Keyboard? Layout? global?
- make mobile responsive, with touch events
- add metronome with adjustable beats

-------------------------
-------------------------
Low Priority

- Flesh out menu: help (modal to explain), settings (?), keyboard shortcut guide (esp. for delete, enter, key + space to select)
- "Help" stuff may be distributed along with elements, rather than just at the top. Use help icons throughout with tooltips? Toggle to hide Help icons, also hides keyboard labels?
- If layout is too busy, add toggles to show/hide advanced info like keyboard shortcuts, some tabs (simple mode?)
- TAB: show info about single notes, maybe as another tab in the key/chord area
- TAB: show sine waves of selected keys or just chord, add up waves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3H621_EdOM
- TAB: single note information?
- show emoji qualities about chords: happy/sad/tense/satisfying/etc.
- invert chords? transpose keys?

-------------------------
-------------------------
Very Low Priority

- chord progression
- guitar tabs
- quizzes to learn notes on staff, chords, keys, etc.
- app to record key strokes, edit staff and add notes and auto play, export/import to save/load compositions
