## Piano Chords

This project is at a very early stage.

To do:

- volume slider with mute
- add onload/buffer for Tone.Sampler to prevent error on page load
- add circle of fifth
- add toggles for labels, keyboard shortcuts, simple/advanced info
- guitar tabs?
- use typescript
- add accessbility (aria)
- make mobile responsive, with touch events
- prevent repeat sounds if pressing and holding keyboard key
